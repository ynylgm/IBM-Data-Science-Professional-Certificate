# Project-for-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

The goal of this project is to obtain the table of neighborhoods in Toronto from webpage and analyze the types of restaurants in specified neighborhoods, cluster the neighborhoods by frequency of various types of restaurants so travelers can make a better decision on which neighborhood to travel to depending on what cuisine they crave.

This project requires key skills covered so far in previous courses and mainly focuses on:
* Handling and acquiring necessary information from datasets using the _pandas_ Python library
* Scraping information from website using the _BeautifulSoup_ Python library
* Making calls to the Foursquare API and obtaining geographical and venues information with Python
* Performing k-means clustering analysis on dataset using the _sklearn_ Python library
* Obtaining geographical coordinates using the Python _Geopy_ package
* Creating maps with superimposed markers and clusters using the _folium_ Python library
