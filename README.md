# Final-Project-for-Python-for-Data-Science-and-AI

This is the final project for the Python for Data Science and AI course for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate via Coursera.<br/>
In the Jupyter notebook published(from IBM Watson Studio), the dashboard won't load so I've attached a screenshot of it separately.

This project mainly focuses on:
* Performing basic hands-on data analysis using our Jupyter-based lab environment<br/>
* Analyzing dataset using the Python _pandas_ library<br/>
* Graphing a dashboard based on dataset using the Python _bokeh_ library
