# Project-for-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

This is the final project for the Applied Data Science Capstone course for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate via Coursera.<br/>
Please see the separate image files for the Maps instead of the Jupyter notebook.

This project requires key skills covered so far in previous courses and mainly focuses on:
* Handling and acquiring necessary information from datasets using the _pandas_ Python library
* Scraping information from website using the _BeautifulSoup_ Python library
* Performing k-means clustering analysis on dataset using the _sklearn_ Python library
* Obtaining geographical coordinates using the Python _Geopy_ package
* Creating maps with superimposed markers and clusters using the _folium_ Python library
