# Final-Project-for-Machine-Learning-with-Python

This is the final project for the Machine Learning with Python course for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate via Coursera.

This project mainly focuses on:
* Building various types of classification models including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression on live dataset using the _sklearn_ Python library
* Performing model evaluations such as Jaccard, F1-score, Log Loss on classification models using the _sklearn_ Python library
