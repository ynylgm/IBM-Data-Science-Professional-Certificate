# Final-Project-for-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

This project is designed to help decide the best location to open a coffee shop in New York, NY based on population, number of nearby operating businesses, and number of competing coffee shops in the vicinity.

This project requires key skills covered so far in previous courses and mainly focuses on:

* Handling and acquiring necessary information from datasets using the _pandas_ Python library
* Scraping information from website using the _BeautifulSoup_ Python library
* Making calls to the Foursquare API and obtaining geographical and venues information with Python **(mandatory)**
* Graphing scatter plots with regression lines using the _matplotlib_ and _seaborn_ Python libraries
* Performing DBSCAN on scatter plot to detect outliers using the _sklearn_ Python library
* Obtaining geographical coordinates using the Python _Geopy_ package
* Creating a choropleth with superimposed markers and clusters using the _folium_ Python library
* Using zipcode search engine from the _uszipcode_ Python library
